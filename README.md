# Hardware acceleration of FIR filter
This jupyter notebook shows how you would go about accelerating a Python function on the Zynq-7000 SoC on the PYNQ-Z1 board. Following tutorial 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoLCtSzj9BU. In the python code, a noisy signal was generated by adding 46MHz and 12MHz sinusoids to a main 200kHz 
sinusoid. First, the filter is demonstrated in software using the **[lfilter](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.lfilter.html)** 
function in Python. The software FIR execution time took 0.08247160911560059 seconds.

In Vivado a free IP called FIR Compiler was used in the design. The output files **fir_accel.bit**, **fir_accel.tcl**, and **fir_accel.hwh**
are then made into the PYNQ overlay.

The overlay was then loaded onto the PYNQ-Z1 board and accessed by the code. The hardware FIR execution time took 0.0036695003509521484 seconds
which is 22.47488 times faster than the software implementation.
